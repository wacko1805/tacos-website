we are doing this because we are bored and we thort of this in a web desighn 
class as we where bored and this started with me saying if you ever feel useles 
remember this is a life guard at an olympics swimming events now of course the 
life gaurd would only need to be there if one went unconsious then some how we 
where figureing out how mutch alchawhole that it would take to fill an olympic 
sized wimming pool this then gave us a really crappy buisnes idea of opening a 
comunal drunk pool but we then researched how mutch money it would cost so then 
the idea of getting a cruise mislle we can then "ASK THE BANKS FOR DONATION" 
with the cruise missle out side of the banck after we get enough we can then 
make a water parck following the same procces
